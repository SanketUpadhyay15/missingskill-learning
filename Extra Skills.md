## __My Final Year Project__

I've made 4 projects in my Bsc.it graduation and my final project was about __Online Plant Nursery Home__ that is used to sell only plants and related things online. 

I've done all the front end and back end coding individually.
I've made some more projects on:
* Gym Management System
* Blood Bank Management System
* Pharmasist Management System
* Online Library Management System
