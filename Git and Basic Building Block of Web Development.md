* When we run any web application on internet then that we run uses web port.
* Ports 80 : for HTTP and 443 : for HTTPS.
* That browser automatically converts our domain into ip addresses.

## Code Editor :
* VSCode
* Notepad ++
* Sublime

* BSD
* MIT
* GPL

## Cloud Providers :
Provides cloud services like IAAS, PAAS, SAAS.

* Azure (Enterprise)
* Vultr

## Database :
* Relational Database : Stores data in form of tables.
    
    * MySQL
    * MariaBD
    * postgreSQL
* Non Relational Database : Stores data in document or as graph.
    
    * MongoDB
    * NeoJS
